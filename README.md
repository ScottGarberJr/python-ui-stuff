little mini ui project made on my ipad using Pythonista and the ui module.

# -------------------------------------------------------
# Name Picker
- DESC:  gui that lets you manually or randomly select names from an 'Available' list and move them to/from an 'Active' list
- TO RUN: Have the name-picker .py and .pyui files in the same folder within pythonista, and click 'run' on the .py program

- UPDATE: I made it work with randint(), and added the functionality to select the other algorithms, but didnt write them in yet (want to work on other projects ':D
